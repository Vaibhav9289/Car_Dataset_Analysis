# Car_Dataset_Analysis
Analysis of A fictional company Mint Classics who deals in model cars and other vehicles. Mint Classics wants to close one of their storage facilities. So this analysis id is for finding patterns or trends to support this decision.
From this analysis,  I observed that:

From EDA:
• Mint Classics have four warehouses a,b,c and d which are in north,east,west and south respectively.
• Mint Classics has 110 Products, 7 Productlines, 122 Customers and 326 Orders till now with an average order value of 32,431.
• Mint Classics orders have risen from 111 in 2003 to 151 in 2004.It also received 64 orders till may in 2005.

From Actual Analysis to Support Business Problem:
• D and C warehouse has least number of products.
• 1 Product with id S183233 has no sales which is  in warehouse B.
• C has least WarehousePctCap and D has highest of it.
• D has the least quantity ordered 
• D has highest delivery time
• D has least quantity in stock 
• C and D have least profitable products
• D has highest no. of  non shipped orders i.e 11.42% of all orders.

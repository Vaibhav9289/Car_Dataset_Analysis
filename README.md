# Car_Dataset_Analysis
Analysis of A fictional company Mint Classics who deals in model cars and other vehicles. Mint Classics wants to close one of their storage facilities. So this analysis id is for finding patterns or trends to support this decision.
From this analysis,  I observed that:

From EDA:
• Mint Classics have four warehouses a,b,c and d which are in north,east,west and south respectively.

• Mint Classics has 110 Products, 7 Productlines, 122 Customers and 326 Orders till now with an average order value of 32,431.

• Mint Classics orders have risen from 111 in 2003 to 151 in 2004.It also received 64 orders till may in 2005.


From Actual Analysis to Support Business Problem:
• D and C warehouse has least number of products.

• 1 Product with id S183233 has no sales which is  in warehouse B.

• C has least WarehousePctCap and D has highest of it.

• D has the least quantity ordered 

• D has highest delivery time

• D has least quantity in stock 

• C and D have least profitable products

• D has highest no. of  non shipped orders i.e 11.42% of all orders.

• A has least orders.

• A has least customer served.

Based on my analysis, it appears that Warehouse D has several indicators that suggest it might be a candidate for closure.

Reasons:

Low Product Inventory: Warehouse D has the least number of products in stock, indicating that it may not be carrying a significant portion of the inventory.

Low Quantity Ordered: Warehouse D also has the lowest quantity of products ordered, which means it may not be receiving as many customer orders as the other warehouses.

High Delivery Time: Warehouse D has the highest delivery time, which could indicate inefficiencies in fulfilling orders promptly. Customers may experience longer wait times for their orders.

Low Quantity in Stock: Warehouse D has the lowest quantity of products in stock, which might imply that it's not restocking as frequently as other warehouses or that it's struggling to keep products available.

Low Profitability: Warehouse D has the least profitable products. This means that the products stored there might not be contributing significantly to the company's overall profits.

High Percentage of Non-Shipped Orders: Warehouse D has the highest percentage of non-shipped orders, indicating issues with order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.

Low Number of Orders: Warehouse A has the least number of orders, which suggests that it might not be as essential for maintaining timely service to customers.

Low Number of Customers Served: Warehouse A also serves the least number of customers, indicating that its closure may have a lower impact on the customer base.
